# Java Learning Reference – Based on *Head First Java*

This repository contains personal notes, Java code examples, and hands-on mini-projects designed to deepen understanding of **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** fundamentals. The structure of this learning path follows the chapter flow of the book *Head First Java*.

## Purpose

To build a strong foundation in Java and OOP by:

- Understanding core Java syntax and structure  
- Practicing OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- Reinforcing key CS concepts through structured code walkthroughs  
- Preparing for software development in Java across academic and real-world applications

> This journey supports my school coursework in **CSOP01 – M027: Object-Oriented Programming**, and aligns with core computing topics like **object-oriented design**, **software engineering practices**, and **Java-based backend development**.

## Structure

The folder structure mirrors the book chapters and breaks down into smaller coding tasks and examples:

| Folder                          | Focus Area                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Chapter01-BreakingTheSurface/` | Getting started, writing first Java program                 |
| `Chapter02-ATripToObjectville/` | Intro to objects, message sending, and encapsulation basics |
| `Chapter03-KnowYourVariables/`  | Variables, assignments, memory, and references              |
| `...`                           | *(More chapters will follow as learning progresses)*        |

Each chapter contains:

- Subfolders (e.g., `01a-FirstApp/`, `02a-ObjectIntro/`) for focused code examples  
- A `README.md` summarizing key concepts from the chapter  
- `.java` files with fully working examples  
- Comments and documentation to explain code logic
