# Head First Java – Learning Reference

This repository contains personal notes, code snippets, and aligned projects for learning Java from scratch using [**Head First Java, 2nd Edition**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/0596009208/) — a brain-friendly guide to object-oriented programming in Java.

## Purpose

To build a strong foundation in Java by:

* Learning core OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
* Writing CLI-based Java applications
* Reinforcing concepts through project-based practice
* Preparing for backend-oriented Java development

>  This series also supports the academic curriculum for **CSOP101 – Object-Oriented Programming**

## Structure

Each folder contains notes, practice code, or full projects aligned with specific concepts:

* `notes/` – Chapter summaries, syntax notes, diagrams
* `mini-exercises/` – Small hands-on code problems
* `project10x-java/` – Full CLI projects linked to Java OOP mastery
