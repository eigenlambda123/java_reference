METHOD: void setUpGame()
	// make three DotCom objects and name them
	CREATE three DotCom objects.
	SET a name for each DotCom.
	ADD the DotComs	to the dotComList(the ArrayList).
	REPEAT with each of the DotCom objects in the dotComList array
		CALL the placeDotCom() method on the helper object, to get a randomly selected location for this DotCom(three cells, vertically or horizontally aligned, on a 7X7 grid).
		SET the location for each DotCom based on the result of the PlaceDotCom() call.
	END REPEAT
END METHOD


METHOD: void startPlaying()
	REPEAT while any DotComs exist
		GET user input by calling the helper getUserInput() method
		EVALUATE the user's guess by checkUserGuess() method
	END REPEAT
END METHOD


METHOD void checkUserGuess(String userGuess)
	// find out if there's a hit (and kill) on any DotCom
	INCREMENT the number uses guesses in the numOfGuesses variable
	SET the local result variable (a String) to a "miss", assuming that the user's guess will be a miss.
	REPEAT with each of the DotObjects in the dotComsList array
		EVALUTE the user's guess by calling the DotCom object's checkYourself() method
		SET the result variable to "hit" or "kill" if appropriate
		IF the result is "kill", REMOVE the DotCom from the dotComsList
	END REPEAT
	DISPLAY the result value to the user
END METHOD


METHOD: void finishGame()
	DISPLAY a generic "game over" message, then:
		IF the number of user guesses is small,
			DISPLAY a congratulations message
		ELSE
