DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses, named numOfGuesses, set it to 0.
MAKE a new SimpleDotCom instance
COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position
MAKE an int array with 3 ints using the randomly-generated number, that number incremented by 1, and that number incremented by 2 (example: 3,4,5)
INVOKE the setLocationCells() method on the simpleDotCom instance
DECLARE a boolean variable representing the state of the game, named isAlive SET it to true

WHILE the dot com is still alive(isAlive==true):
	GET user input from the command line
	// CHECK the user guess
	INVOKE the checkYourself() method on the SimpleDotCom instance
	INCREMENT numOfGuesses variable
	// CHECK for dot com death
	IF result is "kill"
		SET isAlive t false(which means we won't enter the loop again)
		PRINT the number of user guesses
	END IF
