DECLARE an int array to hold the location cells. Call it locationCells.
DECLARE an int to hold the number of hits. Call it numOfHits and SET it to 0.

DECLARE a checkYourself() method that takes a string for the user's guess ("1", "3", etc.), checks it, and returns a result representing a "hit", "miss", or "kill".
DECLARE a setLocationCells() setter method that takes an int array (which has 3 cell location as ints (2,3,4,etc.))

METHOD: String checkYourself(String userGuess)
    GET the user guess as a String
    CONVERT the user guess to an int
    REPEAT with each of the location cells in the int array
        // COMPARE the user guess to the location cell
        IF the user guess matches
            INCREMENT the number of hits
		// FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:
            IF number of hits == 3, RETURN "kill"
            ELSE it was not a kill, so RETURN "hit"
	    END IF
	ELSE RETURN "miss"
        END IF
    END REPEAT
END METHOD

METHOD: void setLocationCells(int[] cellLocations)
    GET the cell locations as an int parameter
    ASSIGN the cell locations parameter to the instance variable locationCells
